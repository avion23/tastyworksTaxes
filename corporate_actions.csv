#   date   = YYYY-MM-DD (must match transaction date)
#   symbol = Stock ticker (e.g., USO, TSLA)
#   ratio  = New shares / Old shares (e.g., 0.125 for 1:8 reverse split, 2.0 for 2:1 forward split)
#   source = Where you got this information (for audit trail)
#
# Examples:
#   1:8 reverse split  → ratio = 0.125  (1÷8)
#   1:5 reverse split  → ratio = 0.2    (1÷5)
#   2:1 forward split  → ratio = 2.0    (2÷1)
#   3:2 forward split  → ratio = 1.5    (3÷2)
